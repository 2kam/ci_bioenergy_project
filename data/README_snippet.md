# ðŸ“„ Bioenergy Supply Dataset â€“ CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire (14 Districts)

This file documents the assumptions and construction logic for the dataset `regional_supply_full_corrected.csv`, which represents estimated annual bioenergy supply (in GJ) for each of CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoireâ€™s 14 autonomous districts. The table supports spatially explicit scenario analysis for clean cooking and future sector coupling models.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset Construction Assumptions

### 1. Spatial Scope
- All estimates are aligned with CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoireâ€™s **14 autonomous districts** (ADM1).
- Where source data was at a lower administrative level (ADM2), it was aggregated to district level using official mappings.

### 2. Empirical Estimates
Supply estimates were directly derived from field-verified sources:

- **Cocoa Pods** in:
  - Montagnes, Bas-Sassandra, Sassandra-MarahouÃ©  
  - Source: *RVO (2021), GIZ/GBN (2020)*  
  - Assumed energy content: **21 GJ/t**

- **Palm Oil Residues (EFB)** in:
  - Bas-Sassandra, GÃ´h-Djiboua, Lagunes, ComoÃ©  
  - Source: *Biokala, LONO studies, RVO*  
  - Assumed energy content: **8.5 GJ/t**

- **Rubber Wood** in:
  - Lagunes and ComoÃ©  
  - Source: *SBP-certified supply base reports (2021)*  
  - Energy content: **15 GJ/t**

### 3. Urban Biowaste (Abidjan)
- Based on ~600,000 t/year of biodegradable waste
- Assumed energy content: **7 GJ/t**
- Total supply: **4.2 million GJ/year**
- Sources: *Feasibility Study on Biogas/Compost (2023)*, *GBN Sector Brief*

### 4. Extrapolated Supply (Proxy-Based)
For districts lacking empirical data:
- Supply = `Rural Households Ã— Mean Biomass Intensity`
- Intensity derived from known districts with measured biomass supply
- Assigned technology: `"Mixed Biomass"` and `"Mixed (proxy)"`
